# Assignment 3: Perceptron Implementation for Logic Gates  

## Overview  

This assignment implements a Perceptron model to classify the outputs of basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). The implementation includes:  
- A custom Perceptron model built from scratch using NumPy.  
- Scikit-learn’s built-in Perceptron for comparison.  
- Visualization of decision boundaries for AND, OR, and NOT gates using Matplotlib.  

## Repository Structure  

- `LogicGateOperation.py` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Main Python script containing Perceptron implementations and plotting functions.  
- `README.md` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: This file.  

## Requirements  

To run the code, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)  
## Code Link

# Assignment 4: Perceptron Classifier on the Iris Dataset
 ## Overview
  This assignment implements a Perceptron classifier using both:
  - A custom Perceptron implementation (from scratch)
  - Scikit-learn’s built-in Perceptron

 The goal is to perform binary classification on a subset of the Iris dataset (setosa vs. non-setosa) and visualize the decision boundaries.
 
 ## Repository Structure
 
 - `irisDataSet.py` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Main Python script containing the Perceptron implementations and plotting functions.
 - `README.md` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: This file.
 
 ## Requirements
 
 To run the code, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
 
 
 
 Upon execution, two decision boundary plots will be generated:
 - One for the custom Perceptron implementation.
 - One for the scikit-learn Perceptron implementation.
